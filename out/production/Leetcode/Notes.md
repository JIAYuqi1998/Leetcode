# No.20 Valid Parentheses
The main idea is using stack. When encounter the left Parentheses, we push it into the stack. If we encounter a right Parentheses, we need to check whether the stack is empty, if not, check whether the first item in stack meets with the right Parentheses now.
After iterating through the whole string, if the stack is not empty, which means there are still some left Parentheses not matched, return false. If it is empty, all the Parentheses in the string are matched.
# No.21 Merge Two Sorted Lists
Firstly, I use the general idea, scan through l1 and l2 until one of them is empty, add the smaller value of l1.val or l2.val to return answer. When one of them is empty, add the other segment as the `next` for answer. However, Always remember that when java creates a class with a value, the value is not null, if its int, then the default value is 0; we can treat it as the dummy head for convenience.
The other solution is recursion. When the input class is the same as the output, we could always consider recursion.
